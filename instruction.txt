The site can have any number of pages as long as there is a clear purpose for each one. It must have the following features.

1.Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages/ functions and to locate relevant information
2.Consistent style across the pages through use of CSS
3.Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window.
4.Use of Bootstrap
5.Clearly stated purpose for each page.
6.Clear landing page (this might just be a special page that introduces the site, or some instructions)
8.ONLY If you are making the collaborative drawing app: it should allow the user to specify at least 16 colours, 3 drawing methods (e.g. different brushes, line thickness, or other style feature) and a save or export function.
9.ONLY If you are making a data visualisation app : it should use data from a different source (i.e. not the music data), visualise it in at least on three ways not covered in the example (using viz.js), and be interactive in some way.
